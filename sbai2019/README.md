# Suplementary material for the SBAI 2019 paper
This material includes:
* Datasets used in experiments and their division (train/test) for holdout 70/30;
* Classification models (MLP, SVM linear, Logistic, J48) trained with WEKA for each dataset;
* Classifier files generated with our tool for each WEKA classification model;
* PlatformIO projects that were deployed in the embedded platforms (Arduino Mega 2560, Teensy 3.2, and Teensy 3.6);
* Accuracy, maximum and mean classification time measured in the test set for each classifier.
